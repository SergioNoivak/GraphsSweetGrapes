# GraphsSweetGrapes

It is a web app made with cytoscapejs that allows the visualization and execution of graph algorithms with the sweetness of a bunch of grapes. It is very easy to learn graph algorithms with this tool.

Here we have implemented three of the most common algorithms in graph theory, Dijkstra, DFS and greedy coloration.You can choose the algorithm in the upper input field.

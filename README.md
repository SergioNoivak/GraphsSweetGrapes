# GraphsSweetGrapes

It is a web app made with cytoscapejs that allows the visualization and execution of graph algorithms with the sweetness of a bunch of grapes. It is very easy to learn graph algorithms with this tool.

## installation

For the installation you need a server available, it can be the local Apache server or similar. After that, simply clone the repository in the server folder and run the index.html file. The index.html file, available in the src directory is the initial file of the software.


## Algorithms

Here we have implemented three of the most common algorithms in graph theory, Dijkstra, DFS and greedy coloration.You can choose the algorithm in the upper input field.

The green button executes the selected algorithm and the Details button of the last execution shows a modal with details about the last algorithm executed, perfect for the learning of algorithms in graphs.

## technologies


The technologies used were [cytoscape.js!](https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape.js), an open source tool for generation of graphical interface for route problems, Bootstrap was also used to create the forms. For the logic of the algorithms was used the language Javascript.
